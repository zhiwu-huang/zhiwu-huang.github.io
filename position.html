The positions are open for those who are interested in researching Generative AI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. For these PhD projects, we could offer studentships funded by the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Southampton. Each studentship comprises a tuition fee cost and a stipend for 3.5 years. This kind of PhD positions are open to UK based students, as well as international students that might be limited by our international funding.

         We are currently seeking PhD students to join the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/groups/vision-learning-control"> VLC group </a> at the University of Southampton. This exciting opportunity is ideal for individuals passionate about researching one of the following topics: 1) Generative AI, 2) Protecitve AI, and 3) Emotional AI, in the context of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Successful applicants for these PhD positions will have the chance to receive studentships funded by the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Southampton. Each studentship covers tuition fees and provides a stipend for a duration of 3.5 years. These positions are open to students from UK, Horizon Europe qualifying countries and other countries. Note that as a result of the UK rejoining Horizon Europe, students from countries eligible for Horizon Europe are entitled to home-level tuition fees rather than international fees. This change has the potential to enhance their likelihood of obtaining PhD scholarships. <b> Check out our published adverts (<a href="./Positions/1-generative_modeling.pdf">advert 1</a>, <a href="./Positions/1-deepfake.pdf">advert 2</a>, <a href="./Positions/1_biosingal_learning.pdf">advert 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/projects/sustainable-generative-ai-models"> advert 4 </a>) or go for the pre-application detailed below! </b> <br><br>

	 <h3> Project Description</h3>
	  
	 This PhD project explores machine learning techniques for affective computing that automates the process of recognizing, interpreting and simulating human affects (e.g. facial emotion generation). The motivation of this project is that the current affective computing domain suffers from remarkable expenses and ambiguities on manual annotations. Accordingly, this project focuses on developing novel generative machine learning models to simultaneously synthesize expressions of emotions and learn the emotion label space, by training the machine learning models over either publicly available data or collected data in the group. The learned label space is expected to be interpretable, complete, and continuous to represent both pure and mixed emotions precisely. Meanwhile, the learned continuous label space enables us to produce more plenary expressions of emotions. Therefore, this project will establish a novel direction that machines can automatically learn a more universal emotion labelling system as well as generating more complete expressions of emotions. This project allows for the access to Iridis 5, the University of Southampton’s recently upgraded supercomputer, considered one of the most powerful in the UK. In this project, the student will gain a deep understanding of novel algorithms in computer vision, machine learning, affective computing and generative modelling.<br><br>

         Successful candidates are expected to have a strong background in computer science and preference would be given to those with good understanding of computer vision, machine learning, and good programming skills. You will join the <a href="http://ecs.soton.ac.uk"> School of Electronics and Computer Science </a> that is ranked 1st in the UK for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Guardian University Guide 2022) at the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk"> University of Southampton </a> which is ranked in the top 1% of universities worldwide. You will be supervised by world leading academics in their field and join an extraordinary and vibrant team of postdoctoral researchers and other PhD students. The student will also benefit from our significant networks. For instance, we lead the <a href="https://tas.ac.uk">UKRI TAS Hub </a>, we are part of the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/the-alan-turing-institute/index.page">Alan Turing Institute</a>, and we run the <a href="https://www.mindscdt.southampton.ac.uk">MINDS CDT</a>. These centres and networks will offer you a valuable opportunity to work with researchers and other stakeholders from a wide range of backgrounds. We will support the development of your future career (networking with more than 100 industry partners and universities across the UK) and provide opportunities to expand your experience and knowledge beyond the topic of the PhD project. <br>
