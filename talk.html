I specialize in computer vision and machine learning for artificial general intelligence. My current research focuses on generative AI (GenAI) functions of generation, detection, emotion, and action in computers, devices, and robots, with the potential for broad impact in healthcare, art, and education. My research team has been exploring computer vision and machine learning approaches like diffusion generative modeling, geometric deep learning, and continual deep learning. Ultimately, we aim to make machines more capable and controllable, enabling them to better understand both the physical world and human beings.	    	
      <!--My primary research is dedicated to advancing computer vision and machine learning within the context of artificial general intelligence. The overarching goal is to make machine learning (deep learning) models more capable and controllable to understand the physical world.
